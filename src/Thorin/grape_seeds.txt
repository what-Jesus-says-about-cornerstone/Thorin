i am find program, i say:

- automated index - i crawl torrent network, forming the index of files
- query the whole index - i exchange indexes with other find programs so we each have the whole index to query
- index is just data in db - i extract file info and show seeds (pins)
- automatic index echange - we, find programs, discover each other and exchange the list of files
- dht - i use existing dht, not pubsub, to find other find programs to share index (additional field to dht's ping to discover/ask and ut_metadata-like extension to then download index)
- extension - i am an extension of existing torrent network
- i do download files
- system tray - i say no, i run in foreground
