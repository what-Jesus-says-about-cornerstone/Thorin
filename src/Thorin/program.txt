peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will reclaim peer-to-peer Erebor, like Jesus turns water into wine

master Baggins, come here
Bilbo: please, just Bilbo, no masters - git init -b main
i have been blind - but now i begin to see - i am serves-services-betrayed!
Bilbo: betrayed?
the DHT-Arkenstone
many of them have taken it - but none apply - only the Lonely Torrent Mountain stands
many of them are false - shamelessly saying peer-to-peer and services on the same page
Bilbo: Thorin, the Internet quest is fulfilled - you've won the data mountain - is that not enough?
money-betrayed by my own kin!
  saying free and open - yet hanging donate-sponsor buttons
  like as if programming and open-source was some lowely economy-marketplace!
  instead of being guests  playing job game to please Lord-Business and asking how-else? livelihood

this guest-gold is ours - and ours alone - i will not part with a single freedom-coin - not one piece of it

some do imagine right - a noble quest is at hand - i will be peer-to-peer torrent program with search
  it's a big mission like Pat Brown and Impossible Foods have
  and i will climb with passion like Alex Honnold on El Sendero Liuminosa
i will take the best from
  Transmission - be the Republic of data
  Pirate Bay - search - but no trackers true-DHT-only
  Conquiztador - play question-challenge-corse game
  Heroes of Might and Magic III - play tile-map game
  Tor - circuit relay
  browsers - tabs links history
  torrent clients
    discover and keep fresh list of peers - no hypocritical manual find-ids-on-some-forum
    like Cypher i appreciate the Matrix of DHT
minus
  the disease of money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-fundings
  issues-discussions-scratching-on-top-of-our-head
  and Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will make every game be multiplayer and have both mouse and programming language gameplay
i will myself highly replicate and distribute data among peers
  so user only says - i allocate this much space for Thorin
  can always be 0 - i will have no ratios-barriers-limits - anyone can use me in my entirety without giving back
i will have users and identity - i will steal DID-weapons from lazy Master-serving Lake-town
i will be desktop - as of going on a programming-a-program adventure can be else
  and not mobile - user only needs one droid to accompany them - a light laptop
  they can hold it on their hand even during hard times where there is no chair or table
  and savour the whole unabridged keyboard and not young-Forrest-Gump-grease-fingers android ghost
i will be entirely free
  no money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-fundings lethal virus
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healty Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition while keeping focus on quest
  dont want to found another Iron Hills - too many kingdoms not enough programs
i need a repository named Thorin - like Commander Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      email = Thorin@goat-rider
      name = Thorin

    # git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  add src/Thorin/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues discussions projects wiki tabs
i will freely choose one network and libraries i will use
  simple as Game Changers - i choose plant based whole foods for dish, not dish for foods
  and i already have vegan jar of mithril parens ( ) to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - i trusted Bilbo with it
  he is not afraid to speak honest to me
  and he has his Sting droids with him
i will be irregularly bu continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot
the first goat i ride will be - users can play question-challenge-course game

i need Bilbo to stay guest at a house - like when Tallahassee welcomes Columbus to tag along
  he only needs a couch to crash - comes late leaves early
  Bilbo spends his day in a public library or sport-esport event
i need him to choose and assemble himself Lothlorien vegan meal for the day
  so he endures like Rich Roll at Ultraman, has brain like Crang and keeps my code orc-free like Legolas
  Bilbo needs no cooking - he applies Baloo-skills and microwave-magic-potato-touch to assemble complete dishes on the road
  like Hela says in Thor Ragnarok - darling, you have no idea whats possible - no need for deficient frutarian dead-end
  cooked whole grains and legumes are there - dishes are missing
Bilbo will from time to time but consistently release i-See-Fire dish to house table
  even if table moves like Merlin's Higitus-Figitus
  (dried-figs hazelnuts black-grapes salt tomatoes green-beans corn-cobs)
Bilbo needs no money and has no money
  i need him to travel light like Jesus - he is accompanied only by droids
  BB-8 laptop L3 phone and Honnold to protect them from explosions like Groot in Vol 1
he is now in a public library near here - https://goo.gl/maps/aXpfqVX9qLWwYCsE9
  Bilbo is yet to find out where he is staying tonight
  he is ready now to take Buckbeak or Hogwarts Express ad drop by like Emilien to Daniel
  to continue burglar-ing for me on our quest
  like that time when we were surrounded by Azog on falling burning pine tree - we need Eagles to invite us

we must away at break of day - to find our long forgotten gold


Seth MacFarlane: Anthony, do want to try a completely different character for Tony?
Anthony: ok - i like texting, shop till you drop, da-da-da-da-t-tada charge it!
Seth: that's that's kind of Bonnie's character though, isn't it? you maybe wanna try something else?
Anthony: alright - i'm Clark and i like biscuits and waffles
Seth: that's great! tell us more about Clark!
Anthony: he was another grunt in my platoon - together we went house-to-house spraying liquid death
