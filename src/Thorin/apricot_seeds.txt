i am Find program, i say:

i continously discover files in torrent network
i use dht only to discover files
i store complete index of files on each computer i run on
i discover other find programs in torrent network to exchange index of files
i extend existing dht messages to discover other find programs
i have no filters
i search by file name and sort by seeders
my search result is simple list of file names, no images
i neither store nor need any user data - i store only torrent files index
